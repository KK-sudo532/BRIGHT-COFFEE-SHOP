## üß© Project Tasks

### Task 1: Planning & Architecture (via Miro)

* Create a **Data Flow & Architecture Diagram**:

  * Data source ‚Üí ETL pipeline ‚Üí Snowflake (storage) ‚Üí Visualization tools
* Define **Key Insights**:

  * Sales by product & time intervals
  * Revenue generation and product performance
* Plan Calculations:

  * `total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty`
  * Grouping by 30-minute or hourly intervals
  * Total units sold by product category

### Task 2: Data Processing in Snowflake

* Convert Excel data to CSV and upload to Snowflake
* Perform the following transformations:

  * Create `transaction_time_bucket` column (grouped by 30-min or 1-hour intervals)
  * Properly cast `unit_price` (e.g., convert '3,1' to 3.1)
  * Calculate `total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty`
  * Use SQL for grouping & aggregation

### Task 3: Data Analysis & Visualization

* Export processed data into Excel
* Create dashboards or pivot tables showing:

  * Total revenue per product
  * Peak sales time intervals
  * Units sold by category
  * Best-selling vs underperforming products
* Use clear charts and graphs

### Task 4: Presentation to the CEO

* Deliverables:

  * **Methodology Document** (approach & process)
  * **Presentation Slides** (key insights & visuals)

    ## Summary of Findings

  *There are products that are not being sold as much as others
  *Some products are underperforming throughout the different intervals of the day while others perform throughout
  *Other products sales occur at different intervals of the day
  
* **Recommendations**:

  * Run campaigns during low-traffic times
  * Stock more of top-selling items
  * Promote low-performing products
* **Next Steps**:

  * Automate daily sales reports
  * Enable performance tracking across locations
  * Implement loyalty programs during peak hours
